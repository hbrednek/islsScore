# islsScore

This project is a graphical score keeping program for the Isle Sur la Sorgue Trophy, which is an 8-ball tournament held at each plenary session of SC_205/WG-71.  

The tournament is a competition between a set of European partnerships and a set of American/Canadian partnerships.  This program maintains the score throughout the tournament, allowing partnerships to be added at any time and limiting (if desired) the total number of games played by each partnership.

This repository contains all files needed for a Netbeans project.

The program is massive overkill for the simple task of keeping score at an 8-ball tournament, but that makes it even more fun.

Take it and use it as you wish.  Drop me a line if you like it: mre@m79.net.
